Most donations are in the 50K - 200K range (456K transactions), with a total amount of 61.6 billion VND.

While there are only 200 transactions in the 100M+ segment, they make up a significant portion, contributing 70.1 billion VND.

This shows that while smaller donations are frequent, large donations have a massive financial impact.

The data indicates a rapid rise in transactions after Sept 9, with both transaction volume and donation amounts peaking between Sept 10 and Sept 12.

This suggests a surge in support, potentially triggered by heightened media coverage or a critical call to action during this period.

**_Donation Distribution by Segment_**

The pie chart shows donations segmented by donor type (individual, company, collective).

Individuals contribute the most, accounting for 84.92% (540 billion VND).

Companies contribute 8.41% (54 billion VND), while collective groups make up 6.67% (42 billion VND).

This highlights that individual contributions are the primary source of support, although companies and groups also play notable roles.

**_Transaction List_**

These transactions seem to reflect large donations from specific companies or organizations.

**Key Insights:**

Small donations dominate in volume but large donations are critical for the total fund size, with the top 200 transactions (100M+ VND) making a huge contribution.

Individual donors are the largest contributors by far, though corporate and collective donations are still significant.

Donations surged between September 9 and 12, reflecting a crucial period for fundraising.

Most frequent donations are 200K VND, a relatively modest amount, highlighting broad public participation.

**_Additional Insight:_**
A key additional insight is that the internetâ€™s role in spreading information has significantly raised awareness among the Vietnamese public about the consequences of the typhoon. As a result, people have come together to support the affected areas in the north. This is most clearly seen in the dramatic spike in donations between September 9 and 12. During this period, both the number of transactions and the total donated amount surged, demonstrating the effectiveness of media coverage and fundraising campaigns in mobilizing community support.
